        <p>Introduction:<br>
            Quick Response (QR) codes seem to appear everywhere these days. We can see them on posters, magazine ads,
            websites, product packaging and so on.
            Using the QR codes is one of the most intriguing ways of digitally connecting consumers to the internet via
            mobile phones since the mobile phones have become a basic necessity thing of everyone.
            We are creating QR codes by which the users enter text into a web browser and get the QR code generated.
            QR codes, short for Quick Response codes, are two-dimensional barcodes that contain encrypted information.
            Initially developed for inventory management, QR codes have now become ubiquitous in advertising, product
            packaging, and ticketing systems.
            The purpose of a QR code generator is to provide a tool for easily creating QR codes that can store and
            convey various types of information, facilitating efficient data transfer in a wide range of applications
            and industries.<br><br>
            Existing System:<br>
            The previous Existing System for QR code generator has Online QR code generates Mobile apps, Integrated
            Business Software, Open source libraries etc.
            QR codes function by encoding data in a grid of black and white squares. When scanned by a QR code reader,
            the encoded information is decoded, unlocking a variety of actions such as opening a webpage.
            In this system we are developing the project to generate the QR code for the text.
            <br><br>
            Prposed System:<br>
            The proposed we develop in this project is generating the QR code for URLâ€™s and texts.
            We design a user-friendly web interface that allows users to input URLs or text they want to encode into QR
            codes.
            We choose QR code generation API which is already existed to convert the user's input into a QR code.
            Implement error correction mechanisms to enhance the QR code's reliability.
            And we can save the QR Code.
