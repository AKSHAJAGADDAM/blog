        <p>
            Diabetes is caused due to the excessive amount of sugar condensed into the blood.
            Currently, it is considered as one of the lethal diseases in the world. People all around the
            globe are affected by this severe disease knowingly or unknowingly. Diabetes is seen in all
            age groups these days and they are attributed to lifestyle, genetic, stress and age factor. In
            the previous one they used different types of machine learning algorithm like KNN, SVM,
            Na√Øve Bayes, Random forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting but these are not regularized
            and has less performance.So, we are using Random forest algorithm and XG Boost. XG
            Boost is more regularized form high performance and trains fast. Random Forest and XG
            Boost are ensemble methods that combine multiple decision trees to make predictions.
            This project will make predictions whether the person having diabetic or not.
